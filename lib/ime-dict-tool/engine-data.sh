# The engine's data as a release has it: the language model mixed with
# the chat-like pages of FineWeb-2 and of a CommonCrawl crawl, and the new words the crawl
# has that the dictionaries lack, as a word pack. A release-time job, run on a rented machine or
# at home, never in an app build: it downloads some 100 GB and wants 16 GB of memory.
#
#   TOOL=<ime-dict-tool launcher> [EVAL=<ime-eval launcher> SETS=<dir>] [LEXICON=<add.tsv>] [WORDS=<pack.words>]
#     [REMOVE=<remove.tsv>] [READINGS=<readings.tsv>] [MISREADINGS=<misreadings.tsv>] [LATIN=<latin.words>]
#     engine-data.sh <work dir>
#
# The launchers are `installDist`'s (`./gradlew :lib:ime-dict-tool:installDist :lib:ime-eval:installDist`);
# SETS holds the evaluation sets: lib/ime-eval/data/pinyin-new.tsv and the held-out ones of the
# training data (pinyin, pinyin-context, pinyin-chat, pinyin-dialog, small).
# LEXICON is the curated list, lexicon/add.tsv; WORDS the last words-* release's pack of it: its
# words join the model's vocabulary, so the pages are split into them and they get a context, not a
# unigram alone. REMOVE, READINGS and MISREADINGS are lexicon/'s corrections of libime's
# dictionary and LATIN lexicon/latin.words, the Latin words typed inside Chinese, as the app build
# applies them (EngineDataPlugin): with all four the probe and the report measure the data a user
# gets. A path may be relative to where it is started. Out, in <work dir>/out:
#   lm.tar.zst      the model (lm.arpa, as the app build unpacks it)
#   new.words       the curated list's words as a pack (with LEXICON)
#   pack.words      every candidate that passes, read as the dictionary reads its words: for curating
#   candidates.tsv.zst, examples.tsv.zst, probe.tsv.zst  every candidate's numbers, three sentences of
#                   each packed one, and what the engine types for its reading now (with EVAL): the
#                   rest of a curator's batches (lexicon/tools/batches.py)
#   report.txt      the evaluation (with EVAL), of the model alone (with WORDS, as the app has it) and with each pack
#   weights.txt     with WEIGHTS="0.4 0.8" (and EVAL): the model alone mixed at each of those weights,
#                   evaluated as report.txt's first line, to choose the next release's weight by
#   manifest.txt    what went in, the SHA-256 of what came out
# Each step leaves done/<step> and is skipped when run again, so a run stopped halfway goes on where
# it was; data and every step after it are made again when the corrections or LATIN change, and clean
# and mix too when the tool does (crawl keeps the shards it fetched, and the manifest names the jars
# that fetched them).
# done/ is beside out/, not in it, as most steps' work is too, so out/ copied onto another
# machine does not pass for the work there. Needs java 21, curl, zstd, sha256sum.
#
# What goes in is what was measured: CC-MAIN-2026-39's and CC-MAIN-2026-34's WET files
# 10 to 1509, mixed at 0.6 beside FineWeb-2's two shards (0.4 and 0.8 did no better); candidates seen
# 15 times, pmi 1 and entropy 1 or more (a run of two entropy alone: NewWords.GATHER_PMI). A newer
# crawl: CRAWL=CC-MAIN-... (and FROM, FILES); several, CRAWL="CC-MAIN-... CC-MAIN-...", the same files of each.
# Since then WebText, CommonCrawl (MIN_HAN) and PageCleaner count Extension A as Han too (TextChars), as NewWords did.
